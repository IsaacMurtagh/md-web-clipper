# Privacy Policy

Markdown Web Clipper does not collect, store, or transmit any user data.

All processing happens locally in your browser. The selected HTML is converted to Markdown entirely on-device and copied to your clipboard. No data is sent to any server.

This extension requires the following permissions:

- **activeTab** — to access the content of the current tab when you activate the picker
- **clipboardWrite** — to copy the converted Markdown to your clipboard

No analytics, tracking, or third-party services are used.
